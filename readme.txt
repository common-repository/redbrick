Simple anti-spam plugin for WordPress blogs.


== Description ==

RedBrick is able to block most of the automated spam comments a WordPress blog receives daily.

It is based upon a score system that ensures spam comments are blocked as soon as possible, so as to minimise the number of checks each comment must go through. When in doubt, RedBrick always holds the comment in the moderation queue. Comments identified as spam, however, never reach the database.

As a last resource in discerning the kind of comment under examination, RedBrick takes account also of the comment author's history.

**The plugin is designed to work on low-to-medium traffic blogs.**
